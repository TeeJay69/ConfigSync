# v2.7.2
### Fixes
- Delete: Fixes error that led to failures when users tried to delete saves (directory was not found)
    - Explanation: timestamp_to_str_ymd() used localtime, whereas timestamp() and ymd_date() both used UTC. When your local time zone is ahead or behind UTC, especially around midnight, the dates produced by these two functions can differ by one day.
    - Example: if it's 1 AM local time on November 25th but still November 24th in UTC, ymd_date() will return 2023-11-24 (UTC date), while timestamp_to_str_ymd() will return 2023-11-25 (local date).

# v2.7.1
### Fixes
- Sync: Fixes error that would always sync the Elgato-StreamDeck regardless of the sync status
    - Explanation: The get_sha256hash() function is using fopen() which cannot handle non-ASCII filenames. The function threw a Runtime-Error which caused the catch statement to be executed and within that catch, the sync state was set to (equal = 0 (false)). The streamdeck program included non-ASCII named files which caused the issue
    - Fix: Added a new get_sha256hash_cpp function which avoids the fopen() function.
    
# v2.7.0
### New program supported
- Steam
> saves all settings, custom artwork etc.

### Fixes
- Sync: Fixes error that prevented Fusion360 from being synced
    - Explanation: A missing backslash in ""C:\\Users\\" + uName + "\\AppData\\Roaming\\Autodesk\\Neutron Platform\\Options\\" + get_fusion360_dir()" (after "Options") led to a non existing path string.
- Cleanup: Fixes logic error that prevented deletion of the oldest save if the save count is above the savelimit
    - Explanation: The current day was falsely used to create a path that might not exist (currentDay\\oldestTst). Now it correctly converts the oldestTst to a YYYY-MM-DD string format which is used to construct the correct path of the oldest save.

# v2.2.1
### Fixes
- Sync/Status: Prevent error when trying to sync a program whose previous save was a forced save
    - Explanation: Forced saves can include files that are not copied by a normal save (e.g. due to file locks by running instances of the target program). When you try to do a normal sync after a forced sync, the program will try to compare the hashes of the files from the previous save with the corresponding "current" files. When we try to hash a locked file, we get a runtime_error.
    - Fix: The program interprets a failed hash attempt as "out-of-sync"
    - Logs: All failed attempts including the filepath are logged.
